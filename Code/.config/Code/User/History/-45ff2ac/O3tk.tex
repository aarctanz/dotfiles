\section*{Hardwire and Microprogrammed control}
\subsection*{Hardwire control}
Hardwired control is a control mechanism that generates control signals by using an appropriate finite state machine (FSM). Hardwired control is a control mechanism that generates control signals by using an appropriate finite state machine (FSM).
\subsection*{Microprogrammed control}
Microprogrammed control is a control mechanism that generates control signals by using a memory called control memory that stores the control signals. Microprogrammed control is a control mechanism that generates control signals by using a memory called control memory that stores the control signals.
\section*{RISC and CISC processors}
\subsection*{RISC}
RISC stands for Reduced Instruction Set Computer. RISC is a type of microprocessor architecture that uses a small, highly-optimized set of instructions. RISC processors are designed to execute a small number of instructions at a very high speed. RISC processors are designed to execute a small number of instructions at a very high speed.
\subsection*{CISC}
CISC stands for Complex Instruction Set Computer. CISC is a type of microprocessor architecture that uses a large, complex set of instructions. CISC processors are designed to execute a large number of instructions at a moderate speed. CISC processors are designed to execute a large number of instructions at a moderate speed.
\section*{Multiprocessing and Multiprocessors}
\subsection*{Multiprocessing}
Multiprocessing is the use of two or more central processing units (CPUs) within a single computer system. Multiprocessing is the use of two or more central processing units (CPUs) within a single computer system.
\subsection*{Multiprocessors}
Multiprocessors are computer systems that have two or more processing units that share the same memory and are connected by a bus. Multiprocessors are computer systems that have two or more processing units that share the same memory and are connected by a bus.
\section*{Parallel Processors}
Parallel processors are computer systems that use multiple processing units to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
