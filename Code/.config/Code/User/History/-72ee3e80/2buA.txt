Trends in case filing and disposal over time
Between 2010 and 2018, the total number of cases filed saw a dramatic rise of 220%, increasing from 42,81,327 in 2010 to 1,37,24,299 in 2018. Interestingly, while the volume of cases filed surged, the rate of case disposals grew even more impressively. The number of cases disposed of jumped from 6,35,001 in 2010 to 1,22,55,352 in 2018—an astounding increase of over 1800%.
	
Comparison between states
Over the past nine years, Uttar Pradesh recorded the highest number of cases filed, with a staggering 12744179 cases. In contrast, Ladakh saw the fewest, with just 671 cases filed.
When it comes to disposal rates, Diu and Daman, DNH at Silvasa, and Ladakh stand out with a perfect 100% disposal rate—though it's worth noting that these regions also had the lowest number of cases. Among the states with over 1,00,000 cases, Chandigarh and Goa emerged as top performers, each disposing of approximately 86% of their cases. On the other hand, Bihar lagged significantly, managing to dispose of only 43% of its total caseload.
Looking at average case duration, Orissa took the longest time to resolve cases—683 days on average—while Sikkim led the efficiency chart, with cases disposed of in just 118 days on average.

Comparison between districts
Over the past nine years, Ahmedabad has consistently led the country’s districts in terms of case filings, with an astonishing total of 5.08 lakh cases registered during this period. 
At the other end of the spectrum, the serene island territory of Lakshadweep recorded the lowest number of cases, with just 248 filings — a number that reflects its small population and relatively quieter legal landscape.
When it comes to disposing of cases, a few regions stood out with spotless records. Districts like Lakshadweep, Diu, Mangan, and Churachandpur achieved a flawless 100% disposal rate. However, it’s worth noting that these perfect scores often came from areas with very few total cases, making complete disposal more attainable.
Among the busier districts — those handling more than 1 lakh cases — Ludhiana and Gautam Buddha Nagar emerged as models of efficiency, each successfully clearing over 85% of their caseload. In contrast, districts like Patna and Ghaziabad struggled under their workloads, managing to dispose of only 46% and 48% of their cases respectively over the same period.
In terms of how long cases take to reach resolution, the numbers paint a telling picture. Surajpur (Chhattisgarh) holds the unfortunate distinction of the longest average case duration, with litigants waiting an average of 1005 days — nearly three years — for justice. On the brighter side, Gyalshing (Sikkim) proved remarkably efficient, wrapping up cases in just 54 days on average, a figure that reflects both speedy proceedings and a relatively modest caseload.
